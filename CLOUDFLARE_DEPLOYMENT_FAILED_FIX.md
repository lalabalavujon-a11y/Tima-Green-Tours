## ðŸ”§ **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: tima-green-tours
3. Make it Public
4. Don't initialize with README
5. Click "Create repository"
```

### **Step 2: Add Remote and Push Code**
```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/tima-green-tours.git

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit all changes
git commit -m "Initial commit with all files"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Verify on GitHub**
```
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Make sure all files are there
3. Check that you're on the "main" branch
```

### **Step 4: Reconnect to Cloudflare**
```

```
